# Frida All The Things

This talk is an introduction to Frida, with examples in iOS where we go from knowing nothing about Frida into using it to reveal the inner working of an iOS application.

The scripts were developed by the presenter and you can find them in the [friOS](https://github.com/integrity-sa/friOS) repo.

The videos referenced in the slides are in the videos folder, by the order they appear in the slides.

The talk wasn't recorded :/ at the Pixels Camp 2017 conference, so no video.
